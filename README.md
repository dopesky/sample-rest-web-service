# Sample Web Service in PHP
This project showcases a web service implementation in `PHP`. The Web Service is built with `REST`.

## Requirements
- [Xampp for Windows](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
- Internet Connection.

## How to Run
- Clone this repo in your local web server.
- Start Apache and Mysql *(from Xampp Control Panel)*.
- Copy the `api/v1/.env.example` file to `api/v1/.env` and update the variables to fit your local environment.
- Go to the url you set as your base_path in the `api/v1/.env` file above. This should be the url that leads to the base [index.php](https://github.com/dopesky/sample-rest-web-service/blob/live/index.php) file.
